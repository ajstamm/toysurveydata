Description: The purpose of this package is to create fake or toy data based on 
    settings provided in a table. Settings should be based on the survey 
    questions. Question types allowed include continuous variables (such as 
    height), date ranges (such as survey completion date), single-selection 
    categorical variables (such as Likert scales), and multiple-selection
    categorical variables (such as "Pick your three favorite ...").
