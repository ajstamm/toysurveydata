# Toy Survey Data

An R package designed to simplify the process of creating fake survey
data.

## Why create this package?

This R package began as a project to create a simple fake dataset based
on annual Community Health Assessment surveys. I was preparing to give a
presentation on cleaning and validating survey data, but I did not have
access to real survey data, for which privacy and confidentiality are
major concerns. I reviewed some existing survey creation packages, but
they either did not allow the level of customization I needed or used
models that read in real data, which I did not have, as a starting
point.

## What does this package do?

This package was built initially to generate responses for individual
categorical questions based on *a priori* knowledge of response
proportions. Some numeric variable and date handling were added later,
mostly based on normal distributions.

While functions can be used individually, the package is designed to
allow you to build a settings table, then run most functions on that
table to generate the full dataset.

## Getting started

This package is still in active development, but you can install it
directly from GitHub using the code
`devtools::install_github("ajstamm/toysurveydata")`.

To create your dataset, you will need to read in a table of pre-defined
variable settings. Learn how to set up your table in the [Settings Table
Design](https://ajstamm.github.io/toysurveydata/articles/settings_table.html)
vignette. The package is designed so that if your table is set up
correctly, you can run nearly all functions on that one table.

## Limitations of this package

This package is designed to be very simple and easy to run. It does not
consider relationships between variables. It includes optional
missingness and a function to introduce random error of different kinds
to your data.

## Future plans

1.  Add an option in the select-many function to require an exact number
    of selections
2.  Add a function to handle ranked choice questions
3.  Add error-creation functions for text values such as random
    upper/lower-case, misspellings
4.  Add non-random missingness
5.  Rethink or improve instructions for percent missing and number of
    options in the settings table
6.  Maybe integrate with or suggest packages that handle things like
    random addresses
7.  Maybe make the IP function at least nominally geographically
    sensitive
